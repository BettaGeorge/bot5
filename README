To configure the bot, create a file named .env in any directory above the
bot5.py file (e.g. in your home directory is fine) containing the following
lines.


BOT_CONFIG=/path/to/config/directory
DISCORD_TOKEN="my_cool_token"
DISCORD_GUILD="name of my guild"
BOT_EMAIL="me@somewhere.net"
BOT_EMAIL_PASSWORD="password to the smtp server"
